""" grounding module

    This module does a reverse grounding procedure.
    Given the image we generate some text and take the text
    to generate a search query. The search results are the
    items of grounding but the generation happens beforehand
    so this is a reverse grounding procedure. Just a term I
    heard from Maye Dupp my friend who is also an AI researcher.
